# Bot Battles Player Analysis: An Introduction
The data comes from a gaming company that runs periodic gaming events for a game called Bot Battles. Gaming events last several hours and happen at most once a day. Last year, 147 gaming events occurred with 980 out of 1100 registered players playing in at least one gaming event. The dataset contains information on point scores as well as categorical information on player demographics and attributes.

I've broken the code in the project up into parts and written about each one separately:
* [Part 1](https://nbviewer.org/github/papir805/bot_battles_player_analysis/blob/master/part1_loading_and_cleaning_data.ipynb): Import the data into a PostgreSQL database and perform cleaning as necessary.
* [Part 2](https://nbviewer.org/github/papir805/bot_battles_player_analysis/blob/master/part2_eda.ipynb) Explore the dataset and attempt to understand the game better, focusing on point totals as a measure of user activity. Use SQL to query the dataset and Python to generate visualizations.
<!-- * [Part 3](https://github.com/papir805/bot_battles_player_analysis/blob/master/part3_correlation.ipynb) Use hypothesis testing and regression modeling to answer the question about correlation. -->
