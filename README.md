# Case Study: Mobile App Data
A case study using one year's worth of mobile gaming data to determine if there's any correlation between user attributes and user performance. The case study is broken into three parts:
* [Part 1](https://nbviewer.org/github/papir805/mobile_app_data_analysis/blob/master/part1_loading_and_cleaning_data.ipynb): Load and clean the data into a PostgreSQL database
* [Part 2](https://nbviewer.org/github/papir805/mobile_app_data_analysis/blob/master/part2_eda.ipynb) Perform an exploratory data analysis to familiarize myself with the game and its data
* [Part 3](https://nbviewer.org/github/papir805/mobile_app_data_analysis/blob/master/part3_correlation.ipynb) Use hypothesis testing and regression modeling to answer the question about correlation.
